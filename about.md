### About Me

By day, Iâ€™m Senior Technical Architect for ChannelSight, a advertising technology company based in Dublin, Ireland.

This blog is somewhere I can scribble my musings on Coding, Software Development, Design, Architecture, Maths, Puzzles and other things that makes my brain tick.

I live in Dublin, Ireland with my Wife and 2 kids. I try to write code at some-what regular intervals. It usually ends up on GitHub, Stackoverflow.

I enjoy photography & try and get out with my camera as much as possible.
