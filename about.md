## About Me

By day, Iâ€™m Senior Technical Architect for [ChannelSight][channelsight], a e-commerce technology company based in Dublin, Ireland.

This blog is somewhere I can scribble my musings on Coding, Software Development, Design, Architecture, Maths, Puzzles and other things that makes my brain tick.

I live in Dublin, Ireland with my Wife and 2 kids. I try to write code at some-what regular intervals. It usually ends up on [GitHub][github] or [Stackoverflow][stackoverflow].

I enjoy [photography][flickr] & try and get out with my camera as much as possible.

if you'd like to contact me you can send me an email to my personal email address: myfirstname.mysurname@gmail.com
